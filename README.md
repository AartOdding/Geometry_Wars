# Geometry Wars
Geometry Wars is a 2D shooter game developped by Dennis Vinke and Aart Odding for the course "Advanced Programming" at the University of Twente. The idea was to create a game using modern c++ (c++17) and moderen opengl (opengl 3.2 core and above), without using any external libraries other than SDL. In the end we decided to also use GLM (opengl mathematics library), and glad (opengl function loader library), because we felt that these topics where not worth spending significant amounts of time on with such good libraries in existence. 

Most of the Entity Component System, and the game logic was coded by Dennis Vinke, and the rendering and audio engine was written by me.
